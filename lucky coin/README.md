# Game description
This game requires a lot of luck. This game is a game where the fox eats coins while moving the fox with the direction keys. Within 3 seconds, the fox has to eat the coin, and if he does, he gets 10 points, and if he doesn't eat, the game ends. There is also a hedgehog, and if the fox touches the hedgehog, the game is over. At the end of the game, the final score is displayed on the screen.</br></br>
